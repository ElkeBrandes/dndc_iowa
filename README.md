# dndc_iowa
Markdown scripts, lists of assumptions, and other data relevant for the IRNC funded project of nutrient leaching from corn/soybean and switchgrass in Iowa.


n_leaching.rmd is the main document where I run all the analyses relevant for the paper. I am changing this document according to team meeting outcomes.
The presented results are in n_leaching_slides....rmd files. I add dates to be able to go back and see how the analysis changed throughout the process.
n_leaching_slides_2016-11-15.rmd: Results presented on 2016-11-15.

I will add python scripts to visualize cash rents and profit data.
